        <br><br><b>1.</b> The colours have been changed dramatically in order to follow the current colour scheme the Cleversteam website follows. This was so customers coming from the Cleversteam site do not actually feel as though they have left the Cleversteam ecosystem. Thus feeling more comfortable using the system. 
        <br><br><b>2.</b> The font has been changed from the default 'Arial' to 'Ubuntu' so that it stands out and is easy to read. It is also the font that the Cleversteam website uses.
        <br><br><b>3.</b> Finally, I have added Icon glyphs to the 'Show' 'Edit' and 'Destroy' links in order to better differentiate between each option. Now with the different coloured Icon glyphs, you can easily identify at a glance what each option does without having to read the word.<br><br><ins>Hover over the image below to see the changes made or click it to open the page.</ins></p>
