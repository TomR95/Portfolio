        <h2>MOBILE. TABLET. DESKTOP.</h2>
        <p>Due to the steady increase in smarphones and tablets, They are dramatically changing how the general public access the internet on a daily basis. No longer is the desktop PC the primary way in which most people access the web. Mobile devices are the reigning champion. This is why it is becoming increasingly important for any modern website to be built from the ground up for mobile  devices first. Luckily thanks to my work in progress BSc Hons Web Degree I know exactly how to create a fully responsive, modern, accessible website.
        <br><br>
        During my time at university, I have taken part in many tasks that relied on working effectively within a team to complete the task. One example of this is when we worked with LEGO mindstorms to program and create a robot that would follow a line on a track and stop when it saw the colour red. The programming language for this was Java.</p>

        <h2> ACCESSIBLE </h2>
        <p> In addition to working in many teams to complete tasks set to a strict deadline over my 3 years at University, I have also worked on many projects alone that make use of many frameworks and programming languages ranging from HTML to Python. In my 2nd year at University, I was introduced to file management systems such as mySQL, github and bitbucket. All 3 I have in fact used extensively.My 2nd year was also when I decided to change my pathway from general Computing to Web Design and Development. This is the module I felt I enjoyed the most due to the burning passion of mine to design, create and develop. I felt websites were a perfect way in which I could display my skills easily to everyone across the world.  <br><br><br><br><br></p>

            <h2>RESPONSIVE</h2>
            <p>Now I am currently in my 3rd and final year at Edge Hill University working towards my degree and absolutely loving it. In fact, my dissertation topic covers web accessibility; I am creating a website and framework that allows a website to meet all the current, nessessary, modern Web Accessibility guidelines set by W3C and WCAG. This means including aria tags so that screen readers have full compatability and also having a clear, easy to read font. As well as high contrast colours that do not conflict with the colour of the text. Features like this could be toggled on or off at the click of a button using Javascript,CSS and HTML.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p>

            <p> High fidelity &amp; Low fidelity prototypes for each page of a website design can be created by me in either Adobe Experience Design or Adobe Photoshop in order to show you exactly what the website can and will look like if you are happy with the prototypes shown.<br><br></p>

            <p>In order for a website to stand out from the crowd it has to be different. That is why I strive for each website I design to be following the cutting edge trends. Having such an eye - catching site easily draws in more customers.<br><br><br></p>
